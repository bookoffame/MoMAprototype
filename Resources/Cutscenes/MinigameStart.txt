Worm:WormA
WHAT? You again?! Can't you just leave well enough alone? Why I oughtta...

Worm Queen:WormQueenB
SILENCE IN MY COURTROOM!

Worm:WormB
Oh jeez, now youz gone upset the Queen. Don't say I din't warn ya!

Worm Queen:WormQueenA
Who dares trespass upon my realm?!

King:King
Wait, I thought the tale was about the old days in my realm?

Worm Queen:WormQueenA
Oh, it is, sweetheart. But it's 2017. What's yours is mine and mine is yours. Now
then, as I was saying... Who dares trespass upon my realm?!

Eagle:GoldenEagleA
Apologies, your highness. My client and I were trying to read the tale, you see, and it
seems that you've gone and put up house in a rather unfortunate location.

Worm Queen:WormQueenB
And so you thought to efface my realm with that lens of yours?

Eagle:GoldenEagleA
I suppose you can put it that way, but my client was merely trying to restore things to the
way they originally -

Worm Queen:WormQueenA
SILENCE! You there, the knight with the lens: you think you have the right to
decide what belongs where? You have no power here! I hereby charge you with intention to
mistake, mislead, and misrepresent - the only punishment for which can be death!

Eagle:GoldenEagleB
Now that's absurd.

King:King
This all does seem a bit ridiculous, dear.

Worm Queen:WormQueenA
Ugh, fine then, not death. But don't think you're off the hook just yet! I have a
game in mind from which there is no escape. Minions: secure the realm!

Worm Queen:WormQueenA
I will grant you both your freedom and your life if you can tell me what thing it is that women
most desire.

Eagle:GoldenEagleC
Objection! Your honour, that's a loaded question!

King:King
Indeed. Overruled. Continue, my slithery queen.

Worm Queen:WormQueenA
Listen and take heed, for only this will you keep your head attached to your neck. But I am a merciful worm.

Eagle:GoldenEagleB
There, look, she even said she's a worm!

King:King
And what a worm!

Eagle:GoldenEagleB
Ugh. I fear that you may just have to play this one out, my friend.

Worm Queen:WormQueenA
You needn't answer now: I will give you twelve months and a day to scour my
realm for the word that will buy your freedom, if you return to this courtroom and answer before
your time is up. Of course, should you fail to find this word, well... I can assure you, your time
will be up. What sayst thou?

Eagle:GoldenEagleB
Listen: I don't want to waste time on this worm either, but what other option do you have?

Worm Queen:WormQueenA
Good. Perhaps there is hope for you yet. Let the game begin!

Worm Queen:WormQueenB
Court dismissed!
