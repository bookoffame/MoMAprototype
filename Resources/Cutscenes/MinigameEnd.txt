Worm Queen:WormQueenA
Silence in my courtroom! So you've returned. You've kept your word and your
day, but it remains to be seen whether you will keep your life. Before all the noble wives, maids,
and widows of my realm, and before me as judge, give your answer: what do women desire
most?

Inventory:Inventory
What is it, friend? Would you like to consult the inventory screen again?

Worm Queen:WormQueenB
Eh, what nonsense is this?

Eagle:GoldenEagleA
Apologies, your highness. My client is merely nervous. Another moment please.

Inventory:Inventory
Chin up, friend! This is no time to be getting cold feet!

Worm Queen:WormQueenC
What? N-no, that's...

Eagle:GoldenEagleC
OBJECTION! Your honour, surely there is no wife, maid, or widow in this courtroom
that would say the contrary.

King:King
Agreed. Your client's life is saved. Isn't that so, dear?

Worm Queen:WormQueenC
Argh, curses!

King:King
Alas, my queen was but a worm all along!

Eagle:GoldenEagleA
That she was. Now if you'll excuse me, I would have my fill.

Worm Queen:WormQueenC
Ack! No! Run away!

King:King
If you would be so kind as to give me the missing letters, I will restore this realm's tale to
its proper order.
